Before reaching our room, the employee spilled hot chocolateand it took him a few minutes to return to the kitchen, change the napkin on the tray and pour in a new cup.  If you want to contribute, you need to make what is important to the other person as important to you as the person is to you.Your six-year-old may turn to you with some kind of nonsense, from his point of view, very important, just at the time when you are busy with work that is of paramount importance to you.
